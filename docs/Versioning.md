## Configuration

### Minimal configuration

Simply add the following lines to `mkdocs.yml` to enable the theme:
[installation methods]: getting-started.md#installation

???+ tip "Recommended: [configuration validation and auto-complete]"

    In order to minimize friction and maximize productivity, Material for MkDocs
    provides its own [schema.json][^1] for `mkdocs.yml`. If your editor supports
    YAML schema validation, it's definitely recommended to set it up:

    === "Visual Studio Code"

        1.  Install [`vscode-yaml`][vscode-yaml] for YAML language support.
        2.  Add the schema under the `yaml.schemas` key in your user or
            workspace [`settings.json`][settings.json]:

            ``` json
            {
              "yaml.schemas": {
                "https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/schema.json": "mkdocs.yml"
              },
              "yaml.customTags": [ // (1)!
                "!ENV scalar",
                "!ENV sequence",
                "!relative scalar",
                "tag:yaml.org,2002:python/name:material.extensions.emoji.to_svg",
                "tag:yaml.org,2002:python/name:material.extensions.emoji.twemoji",
                "tag:yaml.org,2002:python/name:pymdownx.superfences.fence_code_format"
              ]
            }
            ```

            1.  This setting is necessary if you plan to use [icons and emojis],
                or Visual Studio Code will show errors on certain lines.

    === "Other"

        1.  Ensure your editor of choice has support for YAML schema validation.
        2.  Add the following lines at the top of `mkdocs.yml`:

            ``` yaml
            # yaml-language-server: $schema=https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/schema.json
            ```

  [^1]:
    If you're a MkDocs plugin or Markdown extension author and your project
    works with Material for MkDocs, you're very much invited to contribute a
    schema for your [extension] or [plugin] as part of a pull request on GitHub.
    If you already have a schema defined, or wish to self-host your schema to
    reduce duplication, you can add it via [$ref].

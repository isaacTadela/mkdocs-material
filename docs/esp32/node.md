# Every node requirement

## Mesh characteristics

*Self-organized networking* is a feature of ESP-WIFI-MESH where nodes can autonomously scan/select/connect/reconnect to other nodes and routers. This feature allows an ESP-WIFI-MESH network to operate with high degree of autonomy by making the network robust to dynamic network topologies and conditions

## Transmitter (Tx)

1. Send it's MAC addresses

## Receiver (Rx)

* This is the important part containing the csi change we are looking

1. Print the incoming messages


## Code snips

1. hold the table for all the mesh members
2. ping interval should be calc according to number of members in the mesh

## notes?
i need many Tx and 1 Rx to get all the csi data from everyone?? i can filter it by the TAG
